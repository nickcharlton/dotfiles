# dotfiles

A bunch of impossible to live without config files. `bootstrap.sh` symlinks
everything. `USAGE.md` gives some often handy commands.

## Install/Setup

```bash
git clone --recursive git://github.com/nickcharlton/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Dependencies

### macOS

[Install most things][] using the included [`Brewfile`][]:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/bundle
brew bundle
```

### Ruby

[Gems that should be installed with all Rubies][default-gems] should go in
`default-gems`.

### Python

There's a `requirements.txt` for Python:

```sh
pip2 install -r requirements.txt
```

### JavaScript

[`npm`][] doesn't provide a native way to handle global dependencies, so
there's an `npm-globals.txt` which can be used with the following command:

```sh
xargs npm install -g < npm-globals.txt
```
